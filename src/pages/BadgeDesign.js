          <h2>Brief</h2>
          <p>The inspiration came from a anti-counterfeit design elements that are used for security purposes. Guilloche is a pattern of subtle thin lines interwoven according to the rules of geometry. It includes all wavy decorative lines and graphic patterns which are primarily used on banknotes and securities. The use of Guilloche lines might in itself prevent the counterfeiting of products (e.g. certificates, diplomas, gift vouchers, tickets, packaging, and badge). My teammates and I design its badge for EF Standard English Test. By earning badges at different stages or levels, users can see their advancement and feel a sense of progression, which can enhance their motivation to continue engaging with a product.</p>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>The traditional designs can sometimes appear outdated or lack visual, security anti-counterfeit problems, we also consider different formats, such as print and digital, and ensure the design maintains its visual integrity across platforms.</p>
          <h2>Goal</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Balance between tradition, modernity, security and adaptability</li>
            <li>Define the desired visual style, considering branding guidelines</li>
